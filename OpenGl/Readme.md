First project using OpenGL! Super cool to use, will definitely look into doing more complex projects over summer.

This renders two cubes, one with specular shading and one with simple matte shading. If you want to turn off specular shading, press s. It involves a point light and a directional light. Press d to turn off the directional light, and you can see the change in intensity of specular shading.
